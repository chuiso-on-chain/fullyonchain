						<h2>Are NFTs decentralized?</h2>
						<p>Our inspiration was born from this question. What are you really owning when you buy an NFT?. The answer is not simple. In most cases, NFTs are only a link to another place, often centralized, where an image, video or music is hosted. Very few NFT collections host the material in a decentralized protocol or on the blockchain itself.</p>
					<p>We have no doubt that in the future all content will be hosted on the blockchain, from video games to high-quality movies, but today there is very little graphic or sound content recorded directly on the blockchain, the most secure place, and this is due to the high transactional cost "gas fee".</p>
						<p>Cryptopunks, Avastars or Onchain Monkey are some of these projects with very basic designs due to this gas fee problem. We have created a complete 1:1 collection using MIDI, a technical standard that can be used to create melodies in just 1 kilobyte. Nowadays is the only way to host music on the Ethereum blockchain at a high but affordable gas fee.</p>
					<p>We have created the first collection of music in MIDI format hosted 100% on the Ethereum blockchain. As long as the blockchain continues to exist, these songs will exist, regardless of everything else.</p>
						<p>In the following video we show you how you can verify by yourself that the music of Unchaineth Melodies is indeed hosted on the Ethereum blockchain in base64 format. You can replicate this tutorial yourself to check it out.</p>
